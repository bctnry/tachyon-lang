# Aegis Code of Conduct

(https://aegis-coc.github.io/)

1. **Maintain Technological Focus and Ideological Neutrality.** This
   project is committed to technological excellence and neutrality. We
   do not take positions on political, ideological, or social issues
   in the name of the development team. Accordingly, please refrain
   from making such statements under the project's banner, even if
   they reflect personal beliefs or convictions; such declarations are
   not appropriate within the context of the project and should be
   kept separate from technical discourse.

2. **Adhere to Merit-Based Evaluation.** We evaluate contributions
   based solely on their technical merit and relevance to the
   project. Personal identity, affiliations, or background are not
   factored into this evaluation, and should not be emphasized. Please
   refrain from emphasizing such details within project
   discussions. If, after reading this, you still choose to foreground
   such information, you accept sole responsibility for any resulting
   consequences or interpretations.

BY CHOOSING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO CREATE OR ASSUME POSITIONS OF
AUTHORITY, GOVERNANCE, OR REPRESENTATION OVER THE PROJECT OR ITS
COMMUNITY. This includes, but is not limited to, establishing
unofficial forums, channels, or subgroups (e.g. subreddits, Discord
servers) where you claim administrative or leadership status in
association with the project. Should you proceed with such
initiatives, they will not be recognized or endorsed by the
development team in any capacity. Furthermore, the development team
explicitly disclaims any role as a moderation body. There will be no
moderation team empowered to control contributions or project
direction beyond technical evaluation and code review. Decisions about
what is included in the project will remain solely merit-based and
decentralized.
